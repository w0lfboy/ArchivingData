# ArchivingData
This project focuses on archiving and logging data using tar, journalctl, logrotate, and auditd in Linux systems.
I completed this project in my bootcamp at the University of Richmond.  Below is the scenario that I was tasked with when assigned the project.

#Scenario:
  You will play the role of a security analyst for Credico Inc., a financial institution that offers checking, savings, and investment banking services.
  - The company collects, processes, and maintains a large database of private financial information for both consumer and business accounts.
  - The data is maintained on a local server.
  - The company must comply with the Federal Trade Commission's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which requires that financial institutions explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and protect sensitive data.
  
  In an effort to mitigate network attacks and meet federal compliance, Credico Inc. developed an efficient log management program that performs:
  - Log size management using logrotate.
  - Log auditing with auditd to track events, record the events, detect abuse or unauthorized activity, and create custom reports.

  These tools, in addition to archives, backups, scripting, and task automation, contribute to a fully comprehensive log management system.
  
#Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives
#Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs
#Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts
#Step 4: Manage Log File Sizes
#Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

**All of this was done on a Ubuntu VM**
